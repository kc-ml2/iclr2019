# Summary of ICLR 2019 by ML2 members

## Mon, May 06
### Representation Learning on Graphs and Manifolds
* https://rlgm.github.io/
* More robust benchmark needed.
* Geometric DL for moleular surfaces
* Many people are using GraphSAGE.
* DGL vs. PyTorch Geometry
* Le Song
  * probabilistic logic over knowledge graph
  * counter-example of GNN not being able to represent MLN exists, but can augment the GNN (for example variational GNN by Le Song) to do the job.
  * UW-CSE dataset
* Leskovec
  * Why graph hard?
    * large
    * non-unique representations of the same graph
    * long-range depedenecies
  * Graph generation baselines
    * Kronecker, MMSB, B-A
